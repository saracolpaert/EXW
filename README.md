The One Minute Fly

Move your mouse to catch different kinds of fruits to make noises.
Different fruits have different shapes, sizes and positions. The noises depend on these parameters.
After one minute the fly dies and the journey ends. Then you can listen to the entire song you made, catching the fruits.

Have fun!
